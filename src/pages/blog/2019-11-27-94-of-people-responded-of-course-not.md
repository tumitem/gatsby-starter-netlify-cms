That is how the majority answered the question put by Erik van Vooren.



Founder of the Direct Marketing Know-How Institute in Belgium, quoted some time ago, an interesting study. One group of respondents was asked a question: "Is it possible to smoke cigarettes while praying?



# BUT



"When you smoke cigarettes, can you get  pray? 



**92% of the respondents said "YES!" immediately.**



Seemingly the same but not the same! Look at the bigger picture!
